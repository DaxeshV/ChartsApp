## 1. Bar Chart :

      A bar chart or bar graph is a chart or graph that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with 
      heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically 
      or horizontally. A vertical bar chart is sometimes called a column chart.

## 2. Pie Chart :
      A pie chart (or a circle chart) is a circular statistical graphic, which is divided into slices to illustrate 
      numerical proportion. In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice (and consequently its central angle 
      and area),is proportional to the quantity it represents. While it is named for its resemblance toa pie which
      has been sliced,there are variations on the way it can be presented. The earliest known pie chart is generally
      credited to William Playfair's Statistical Breviary of 1801
